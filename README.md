# CT-354 Machine Learning (AI-304)

This repository contains all the lab work, assignments, and projects completed as part of the *Machine Learning (Course Code: CT-354, Roll No: AI-304)*. The course focuses on understanding and implementing core machine learning concepts and algorithms, enabling practical problem-solving using data-driven approaches.

## üìö Course Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on implementation of ML techniques using *Python* and popular libraries.

## üìù Contents

This repository includes the following:

1. *Lab Work:*
   - Implementation of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
   - Practical exercises on preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
   
2. *Assignments:*
   - Real-world problem-solving tasks covering supervised and unsupervised learning.
   - Programming exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts.

3. *Projects:*
   - End-to-end implementation of ML pipelines for specific datasets and applications.
   - Model training, evaluation, and performance optimization.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries/Frameworks:* 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for ML models)
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable for deep learning tasks)
